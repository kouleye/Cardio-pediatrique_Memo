# Cardio-pediatrique_Memo
##code python
this concerns the practical part of my memoir dealing with the detection of cardiac pathologies in children. We present the source code on training, testing and validation with hard code neuron networks. In addition, since the data set consists of only 83 observations, a growing validation was made.
##Code java
the java code here allows the cleaning and partitioning of data into apprentice and test data
##column operates
the columns used represent the medical history of patients (medical findings and clinical signs of patients):
sex, weight, height, BMI, Spo2, blood pressure, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, clinical signs and the target column namely the diagnostic column
The data is too cofidential. you cannot have access
